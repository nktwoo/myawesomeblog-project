			How it works
Here’s what you need to know before getting started with the navbar:

Navbars require a wrapping .navbar with .navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl|-xxl} for responsive collapsing and color scheme classes.
Navbars and their contents are fluid by default. Change the container to limit their horizontal width in different ways.
Use our spacing and flex utility classes for controlling spacing and alignment within navbars.
Navbars are responsive by default, but you can easily modify them to change that. Responsive behavior depends on our Collapse JavaScript plugin.
Ensure accessibility by using a element or, if using a more generic element such as a, add a role="navigation" to every navbar to explicitly identify it as a landmark region for users of assistive technologies.
Indicate the current item by using aria-current="page" for the current page or aria-current="true" for the current item in a set.
The animation effect of this component is dependent on the prefers-reduced-motion media query. See the reduced motion section of our accessibility documentation.
Supported content
Navbars come with built-in support for a handful of sub-components. Choose from the following as needed:

.navbar-brand for your company, product, or project name.
.navbar-nav for a full-height and lightweight navigation (including support for dropdowns).
.navbar-toggler for use with our collapse plugin and other navigation toggling behaviors.
Flex and spacing utilities for any form controls and actions.
.navbar-text for adding vertically centered strings of text.
.collapse.navbar-collapse for grouping and hiding navbar contents by a parent breakpoint.
Add an optional .navbar-scroll to set a max-height and scroll expanded navbar content.
Here’s an example of all the sub-components included in a responsive light-themed navbar that automatically collapses at the lg (large) breakpoint.
